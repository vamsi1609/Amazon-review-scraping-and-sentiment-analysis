Hi thank you very much for showing your interest and I am grateful for your time. I have learned a lots of things after doing this excercise. 

The Case study contains 3 ipython notebooks and 3 csv files.

Scraping ipython notebook contains the code for scraping the reviews from the amazon website for 10 mobile phones. It uses the phone_list.csv for accessing the websites. 

The output is the phone_reviews.csv file which contains the name of the model and the reviews
