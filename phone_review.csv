  Midrange specs ...flagship price? ....fraud company....compare with performance of other brands like realme and xiaomi.....oppo and vivo are doing this fraud business via offline stores ...be not fooled by these companies atleast in the online market wherebwe can compare thereviews , lerformance , camera , quality, price rather than simply believingbthe blunters of salesmen in stores....for example 1.samsung gm1 48mp camera used in reno 2f is used in budget phone redmi note 7s (price 9k)2.This phone has antutu benchmark score of onlyb130ks , redmi note 7 pro has 180-190ks  , realme 5 pro has 180 ks, and even note 7s has 150ks with sd 660Only plus for this phone is super amoled screen and popup camera...This phone worh just or under 15k...Go for realme xt for 15-16 k or if u want to spend 25 k go for k20 proPLS DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY

  Update - After few months and several updates I feel AI image processing quality had increased a bit. But i still feel the camera is not upto mark for the price at which this phone is being sold.UI is very good and updates are regular.Will update the review after using it extensively. The display is very good. Charging was fast. But the camera seems to very poor. AI seems to soften the images too much. My redmi 6 pro offers much sharper images. Possibly updates might improve the image quality.

  It is funny to read some comments in public forums where a few people are blindly, without any technical knowledge are criticizing the Mediatek Helio P70 processor that the Reno series of phones are configured with, or go on comparing this with some totally different set of processor(s) from QualComm's Snapdragon chipsets.The MediaTek Helio P70 is based on TSMC 12nm FinFET production process and incorporates a powerful Arm Cortex-A73/A53 octa-core CPU complex with an impressive Arm Mali-G72 class GPU and a dedicated AI processing unit which provide a clock speed of 2.1GHz. This helps in enhancing performance and gaming experience. Unlike the snapdragon 6** series, P70 is not underclocked. It is seen to outperform SD 660AIE in all tested areas and proves to be the better SoC than SD 675 except the benchmark scores.I am not even talking about the state-of-the-art combinations of the dynamic AMOLED display with full 4K render-ability, or the complex rear quad-cam set up.Just got this great work of innovation this morning in hand and still exploring all its services and suites. It can safely be said that this mobile phone easily outperforms many other big names above its price / class hands down. Go get it, without any second thought.

  Some people think that this phone maybe overpriced. But I have to say it is one of the best phone of this price. I buy this phone for moderate use, not for gaming. The camera of this phone is really  & the audio quality & battary perfect & in-hand fill are great. Nokia is not like other chiniese brands who have a lote of privacy issue . It give you a stock Android with zero bloatware, that give you a good experience for use. Nokia give 3 years security update & 2 years android update.

  ¬†Nokia 5.3 Cyan 4GB/64GBThings I like:* Big Display which is well lit* Light weight* Beautiful back gradient design with pattern* Pure android (Android One) with out of box Android 10 and August Security Update (after updating)* Camera is above average* 2 Major android upgrades (Android 11 & 12)* USB-C & Headphone jack* WHITE NOTIFICATION LED in POWER BUTTON ITSELF* No bloatwares except Google apps* Flip to disconnect call and pickup to silent call gesturesThings I didn't liked:* Camera performance in low light* Screen ratio (bit longer)* Display resolution (720p+ or HD+)* Device battery and processor (comparing to others in 14k price range)In the box:* Mobile Phone, charger (5V 2A), USB Type C cable, earphones with mic, sim ejector tool and documents.Conclusion:It is a relief and life saver amidst the No China campaign. Strictly speaking, you will be more than happy with the performance of this phone if you are average user (not a heavy mobile gamer).This phone is great for daily use and Nokia could have added few extra features. Overall this is a beautiful phone for this price range and one shouldn't expect too much.Go for it, you'll be happy.Note: Charger is ""Made in China""

  Since most of you would already know about the kinda average specs. Here are my impressions of using the phone:> Built feels good, the plastic back panel doesn't feel cheap at all and the buttons are very tactile. The notification light is placed on the power button, which is hard to notice. The back panel has a fine texture, but it doesn't feel or give any extra grip, but the curved edges help in holding the phone better.> Display resolution is not right for the price and screen size. It's 720p+ on a massive 6.5inch screen. There is no outright pixelation, but if you have seen 1080p screens before you would notice that the text and icons are not sharp enough. If you used a 720p phone before then this display would be okayish. Other than that the 20:9 ratio makes the display quite tall. Brightness is decent.> Stock Android experience: Probably the main selling point of Nokia would be the clean Android OS it offers. There are no additional apps installed in the phone, except for some basic Google apps. Even you can choose not to install some Google apps like Duo, Google News, Google Play Music etc during the setup.Some may not like this as most other brands pre-install some social media and utility apps like voice recorders.The phone is upto date with security patches till August 2020 on 5 Sept 2020, which is nice. The optimizations are good and regular apps like social media, browsing and video playback work fine. I don't game, so idea about that.There is 2 year software update guaranteed as a part of the Android One programme.> Battery life: It's excellent, phone is well optimized for battery life. In my two days of use with 4G data on always, the battery lasted very well. I got 2.5 to 3 hrs screen-on-time for every 25% of the battery on regular use. But no inclusion of fast-charging is quite disappointing.> Cameras: Haven't tested much, but GCam seems to work better as seen from some reviews. Will update this later.> Confused hardware: There is NFC (probably because the phone was for European markets) but no information on a Gyro sensor. Though there is a compass, which some say is not available.Other than that you get a clear case and headphones in the box, like most other Nokia phones.Overall, if you want to buy a stock android based phone or cannot wait for flash sales, then the Nokia 5.3 is good.

  After using for two days , I say that a wonderful product designed and developed by nokia, little dissatisfied with the size of the phone, little bigger on size, I've been a fan of nokia since windows Phone, already using 6.1, 6.1 plus and this one is the latest addition in arsenal, the greatest thing is software updates from android one and nokia living upto it's promise. Had no issues with any of nokia phones till date like heating, lag. Zero bloatware and a pure android experience which makes it a wonderful experience to enjoy the phone. Basically I am an iphone user earlier, but after using nokia 3 which is my very first phone after nokia launched in Android, since then I have shifted to nokia completely. A wonderful brand one can rely on.

  This review's to all those who were eagerly waiting for the phone to launch and get hands on, but before all it's always hard to get the ""DEMO"" at the earliest so.. ""IMAGES"" above are to those who can't find demos much often/needed color/to avoid contacts at stores during Covid.Pros - Leather back warmth feelCons - Back Camera's not upto the mark when compared to the phones in market and of this price range, though it has given a sleek and leather finish with minimized thickness. . It's pro fades out its Con so can go for it blindly but only if you think ""CAMERA'S"" not your ""PRIORITY""Features I thought would be there was 9.1 surround music/Dolby Atmos but it comes with:Real Sound Technology, just have a look into it if you're specific2. Super Amoled+ Display.Hassle free(Inside the box):Tempered glass comes on the phone itself so no extra work on fixing, which might sometimes go wrong.2. Silicon back case (if you're looking for touch and feel of leather back, better not use.. but use a side bumper if available for protection) Do also post where we can find side bumper, cos it's hard finding for new phones.. Thanks!Looking for a Standout design in 15-20k range? Then, ""GO FOR IT"" that's Value for money!

  Hi, I am writing this review after 3 days of usage1. Firstly thanks to Amazon. Got delivered at a lightning speed. Ordered ok Saturday. Launch date was on 21st September and got delivered the same day at morning.2. Now about Oppo 17, this is very light weight, speed is good, I ordered dynamic orange. Trust me, this is the best and attractive colour I found ‡•§l, blue is a good option too if you don't like a funky coloir‡•§3. Camera I did not found upto the mark . Night mode is not that great but yes if you are a selfie person, go for it. I was using Ralme Xt earlier and it's camera was much better. But ok I will manage . I am a part time photographer and often I use my phone to click pics. Realme supported me a lot. Let's see how much Oppo supports.4. Speed is good. 6 GB 128 GB. Good combo. No lagging till now. Going smooth.5. Touch is awesome. Phone gets unlocks quickly. No lagging here too .Rest I will use for some more days and come back with my reviews again.

  i like the camera quality, images and videos are sharp and clear. there is a wee bit of noise in low light areas but it can be overlooked.it looks quite a bit like the iphone X but is largerdisplay is on par with iphone xmusic sounded as good as iphone xi could just unbox and get on with it as oppo provided the tempered glass, back cover as well. which was a pleasant surprise as I was not expecting. üòÑAlso the design, finger print sensor on display, face recognition .... lot of features.dual 4G standy by with an SD card is a blessing and I was looking for exactly what this phone offered at the right price and also the back cover made  of leather is so freaking rich and classy.quite happy with what I got. This is probably the fastest decision I have ever taken around buying a phone and I am hoping this will last long, like most of my other phones.

  So it's been three days since I'm using this phone and I'm completely in love with it at the price I got.1. Weight of the Phone is very less when compared to any phone in this segment and this matters a lot to me while carrying or casual music listening or any stuff.2. Back leather type wrapper is really good and gives a premium feel.3. UI is also good in terms of usage and mobile handling and compatibility4. Camera is decent for video calls/ normal phots not that great especially for shotting long-distance objects/ sceneries. But this doesn't matter to me a lot. Come on use a professional camera if you want photography at peaks.5. Design is excellent and it is the slimmest phone at 7.43mm6. Build Material quality is good.7. Sound is good but not that great for melodies or any songs please use earphones/headphones.8. Display is really good and it's out of my expectation as I'm using Samsung AMOLED previously.9. Processor is fast for general purpose and played COD and some other games at medium graphics didn't observe any lag.10. Battery is okay and keeps you charged up for one day (General usage with low- medium gaming)11. Software is fast and no clutter apps or extra apps.Overall I would definitely recommend if someone wants a nice phone for general usage which looks classy.

  At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.

  Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000. I have  doubt  its not 7000 man battery its like 2000 or 2500mah. Heating  issue also faced during  charging.

  Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile. Then help me for return...I am not happy with overall performance of the phone...

  Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage

  There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says ""Incorrect Password"".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue.

  This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8. If you need all trending features to be covered in non Chinese mobile,THEN GO FOR IT... ALSO TRY TO UPDATE TO LATEST SOFTWARE ONCE AFTER SETTING UP YOUR MOBILE, OTHERWISE HEATING ISSUE WILL BE THERE.

  I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average

  After using for more than 2 day's I must say, snapdragon 730g works wonderful .CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mega Pixcel and more feature in selfie camera.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.

  It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)

  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.

  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.

  Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider

  I am using this for last 2-3 days now.This is my review after actually using this pgone in all aspects.Pros -1. Canera - Excellent camera - Good low light photography.  64 Megapixel does uts wor. Inteli Cam is just awesome.2. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent.Touch is just Excellent.3. Phone looks really cool in hands.4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have.5. UI is good.6. Speaker sound is good.7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim.Overall its very nice experience using this phone.I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice.Cons -1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery.I was hoping to get little more backup2. Processor  - Could have been better3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market

  Hi all,From Samsung M31s.Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India.Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount.But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken üíîHandle with care.

  Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India

  Please don't buy it.It's not a quality mobile, it just like Redmi Note 4.  No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth.You can get far better mobile with this price of ‚Çπ18, 500. Its a cheating with the customer because price is high but no quality improvement in comparison with Redmi Note 4.  I feel better Redmi note 4 with lesser price than 9 Pro Max.

  Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.

  Not satisfied with productSince we use redmi mobile brand in my family even base varaint sounds good performance after 2years when am using this for first time. Dis appointment on purchasing this.I tired to record voice from this mobile around 1pm and sound was good. I thought wow such a nice but after 30min . Very aloud recorded voice was under ground the earth. Later I compares recording with redmi 5A andRedmi note 4 and this phone but I couldn't hear anything in redmi note 9pro max. How come within few minutes this change happening in 3hrs useage of mobile in the first day.  Soon charge drains without useage ,What will b future then?

  Honest review, 16 May 2020 product delivered. Ear speaker not working from 10th June 2020. When tried to take service center from same day.. they gave appointment on 17th June 2020.Camera quality is worst... If you want camera then do not buy...In India there should be a law if they say 64mega pixels camera if we do not get even 5 megapixel they should be punishable... As they are selling fake goods..This is my honest üíØ review...

  I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive!Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung.I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too.My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices.1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely.2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well.3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ).4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good.5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not.I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display.It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this.Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes.OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.

  Great phone!Gaming performance is so great, device don't get heat up at all even at high settings!I played PUBG Mobile and details it provides were so exciting and make it feel real. Shadows of tree,stones, mud, etc. If you have small hands don't buy it for gaming, don't feel comfortable with small hands.Camera is good, can't say it is awesome!Battery life is great too, charge too fast!UI is as expected stock android, some pre-installed third party apps were also installed, you can uninstall all of them except Netflix.The back cover they provide is loose and cheap. Have to buy a new better one!Over all a great phone!Cheers! :)

  Great phone, Amazon delivers it within 10 hours of ordering really happy there,Pros: Beast performanceGreat battery LifeBrilliant ScreenFluid 90hzAnd blazing fast oxygen os5gCons:Camera: have a 2megapixel camera for the sake of having 3 camera on the backRest of the camera are only averageHopefully upadates can fix that and given one plus history I think they will!Curved screen cause accidental touches and most covers can't cover phone fully in the front due to display Hence its prone to break more than regular flat screen phone like 7tHave a little bit of weight due to larger batteryPrincing is highly agressive but could have provided wireless charging and headphone jackIn the same price!Overall good phone if you want a future proof phone but this eyes closedBut if you are on a budget 7t can mostly get you there with better camera and almost as fast snapdragon 855plusChoose wisely

  Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get.Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money.Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!
